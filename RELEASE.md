# Releasing a new internal release

This is totally temporary for now. We'll automate this later

1. In the *main* branch change the version in file *VERSION.txt* to the new release version and submit a PR.

1. Merge the PR to *main*. It isn't necessary to wait for the three konflux PRs that change the nudges on the three containers before moving on the next step.

1. Merge *main* via a PR into branch *v1*. _(Eventually we may wish to cherry-pick from main into v1)_

1. Wait for the three Konflux PRs in the [operator (release-1-0) application](https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/storage-scale-releng-tenant/applications/operator-1-0/), and then take the commit of the last nudge konflux commit and pass it to run
   ```
   ./scripts/konflux-release.sh <commit>
   ```
   _(Before running the script you need to be logged in to the Konflux cluster[^1] and to `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale`[^2]. If you are not logged in the script will error out and then once you have logged in it is safe to re-run the script.)_

   This will pull the images out of Konflux and push them into `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale`
   and create a bundle pointing to these images.
   It will also build them locally and push the images with the non-Konflux name (openshift-storage-scale)
   to `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale`

1. Add a tag (the release version) for the *commit* used above and push it to github.

1. It also copies this bundle under ./released-bundles/*version*. Create a PR for it and merge it
   (Hopefully we will drop this step)

1. At this point the *:latest* catalog will contain the new bits. Test these on
   AWS or somewhere. Once you're happy tag the latest catalog image to *:stable* and push it
   to quay.io

1. Amend the [Fusion Access for SAN Install](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dCr9wtK9j5l7nY8w-CCfju93tIV3rcMvslelGkUvEw/edit?tab=t.h0mrtvcsp9vb) doc and announce it on Slack in @team-ecoeng-forum-access mentioning _@fusion-access-qe_ and _@fusion-access-eng_


# Releasing a new official release in the Certified Operators catalog

1. Do a build following the same steps as for a new internal release. This is necessary to get the release version reflected in the metadata.

1. Ensure that the images are tagged in `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale` with the release version number. This is so they won't be garbage collected.

1. Poke Socheat Sou _(IBM associate @ssou in #scale-cnsa-redhat-guest)_ to pull them by digest and upload them to the icr.io registry. The commands will be something like:
   ```
   skopeo copy docker://quay.io/openshift-storage-scale/devicefinder-rhel9@sha256:.... docker://icr.io/cpopen/fusion-access/devicefinder-rhel9
   skopeo copy docker://quay.io/openshift-storage-scale/console-plugin-rhel9@sha256:.... docker://icr.io/cpopen/fusion-access/console-plugin-rhel9
   skopeo copy docker://quay.io/openshift-storage-scale/controller-rhel9-operator@sha256:.... docker://icr.io/cpopen/controller-rhel9-operator
   ```
   The image digest for the devicefinder image can be obtained like this and the digests for the other images similarly:
   ```
   skopeo inspect docker://quay.io/openshift-storage-scale/devicefinder-rhel9:$(cat VERSION.txt) | jq -r .Digest
   ```

1. Once the images have been uploaded to icr.io, generate a bundle/folder + image which points to the icr.io images.
Then we rebuild the latest catalog and do a smoke test, so we can also have qe take a look. Once everything is okay
we commit the released-bundle and use that to generate a PR for their certified-operators repo

1. Then we can do the ISV release on the web page:

   - Run the preflight checks for all three images:
      ```
      preflight-linux-amd64 check container icr.io/cpopen/fusion-access/devicefinder-rhel9@sha256:fef20a... \
      --pyxis-api-token= --certification-component-id=... \
      --certification-project-id=... --submit --loglevel trace
      ```
   - After the preflight is submitted we can create the PR to the certified-operators
   - Once the PR is merged we can publish (or it might happen automatically, to be checked)


# Releasing a new locally built internal release with a new Storage Scale drop

These are the steps for releasing a new locally built internal release incorporating a new drop of Storage Scale from IBM.

First the images in the drop must be uploaded to `quay.io` and a Spectrum Scale install manifest created.

1. Unpack the IBM drop

    A drop from IBM comes in the form of a .zip file downloaded from the IBM Box.
    This zip file contains a compressed tar file which must be extracted. Once this is done you will have a directory with a name of the form `cnsa-v*` containing a script `load_and_push_images.sh` and other files/directories.
1. Login to `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale` [^2]
1. Ensure that your Fusion Access repo is at the tip of main.
1. Upload the drop to `quay.io`

    Change directory to the previously extracted `cnsa-v*` directory and run the script `scripts/upload-cnsa-drop.sh` from your Fusion Access repo.
    When the script completes it will have uploaded the images and created a Spectrum Scale install manifest `install.yaml`. Follow the instructions printed at the end of the script run, to commit the install manifest to the `openshift-fusion-access-manifests` repo.

Next the release is built.

1. Change directory to the top of your Fusion Access repo which should be at the tip of main.
1. Edit VERSION.txt to set the desired release version.
1. Edit CNSA_VERSION.txt to set the version of Spectrum Scale.

    The version is derived from the directory name of the drop, by removing the `cnsa-` prefix, replacing the first _ with a dash and all subsequent ones with a period.
    ```
    echo "<dirname>" | sed -e 's/^cnsa-//' -e 's/_/-/' -e 's/_/./g' > CNSA_VERSION.txt
    ```
1. Delete the install.yaml for the current Spectrum Scale version from the `files` directory.
1. Add the new Spectrum Scale version's install.yaml in directory `files/<CNSA_VERSION>/`. This is the same file as was committed when doing the drop upload.
1. Create a template for a catalog containing the version of Fusion Access we are building in `catalog-templates/<VERSION>.yaml`

    Copy the prior versions template and then edit to add the new version and set the digest of the current version which can be obtained with the command
    ```
    skopeo inspect docker://quay.io/openshift-storage-scale/openshift-fusion-access-bundle:<current-version> | jq -r .Digest
    ```
1. Run `./scripts/update-cnsa-versions-metadata.sh` to update the metadata with the new Spectrum Scale version.
1. Tag the current repo commit with the version number.
    ```
    git tag $(cat VERSION.txt)
    ```
1. Build the release.
    ```
    make VERSION=$(cat VERSION.txt) REGISTRY=quay.io/openshift-storage-scale CHANNELS=alpha CHANNEL=alpha release
    ```
1. Create a catalog for the new version. Run
    ```
    make VERSION=$(cat VERSION.txt) REGISTRY=quay.io/openshift-storage-scale CHANNEL=alpha fbc
    ```
    to create it in `catalog-template.yaml`. Verify that it looks sane and all the placeholders have been replaced.
1. Push the catalog to **your private quay**
    ```
    make REGISTRY=quay.io/<user-name> CHANNEL=alpha fbc-push
    ```
   and then sanity test the build using a CatalogSource pointing to this catalog in your private quay.
1. Once you are satisfied with the build, push the catalog to `quay.io/openshift-storage-scale` which will make the build available internally.
    ```
    make REGISTRY=quay.io/openshift-storage-scale CHANNEL=alpha fbc-push
    ```
1. Commit all the changes made to the repo while making the build and re-tag with the version number.
    ```
    git add ...
    git commit
    git tag -f $(cat VERSION.txt)
    ```
1. Submit a PR to main.
1. Update the [Changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dCr9wtK9j5l7nY8w-CCfju93tIV3rcMvslelGkUvEw/edit?tab=t.h0mrtvcsp9vb) and [Installing or upgrading to 1.1.0-* internal releases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dCr9wtK9j5l7nY8w-CCfju93tIV3rcMvslelGkUvEw/edit?tab=t.p6fuw5gwctzy) sections in our `IBM Scale Container Native - Fusion Access for SAN Install` document.
1. Announce the availability of the new release on the #team-ecoeng-fusion-access Slack channel mentioning @fusion-access-qe and @fusion-access-eng. See previous release announcements for examples.
